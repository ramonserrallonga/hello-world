# hello-world

I am a dreamer with the aspiration to make our world a better place to live. Through my experiences in different latitudes, I discovered how similar individuals are across cultures and how diverse communities are across borders.

My passions are data analytics and innovation. I apply them in anything I do. My professional career has been developed in the intersection between business and technology. Connecting the dots to deliver more value.
